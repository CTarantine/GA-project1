## Overview

The goal of this project was to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game that involved manipulating the DOM. I chose to create a unique version of the popular trivia game of Jeopardy.

## How to play

Each card deck contains a set a of questions with point values correlated to level of difficulty.

A correct answer adds points assigned to chosen category.

An incorrect answer subtracts points assigned to chosen category.

The user has the option to choose a different point category on each turn.

Cards will black out afer all questions in that category have been answered.

The user has the option to challenge themselves to answer the question in 30 seconds or less by playing a clip of Jeopardy themed music when the question appears.
